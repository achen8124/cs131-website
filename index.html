    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
    <h2>HMC CS 131, Spring 2023</h2>
    
    <h3>Welcome to CS 131!</h3>
    <p>This Sakai page is the home for our course this semester. The links on the left will take you to additional course content (syllabus, modules, assignments, gradebook, how-tos, etc.) and some common important links are here below on this page.</p>
    
    <h3>Course Format</h3>
    <p>This is a flipped class. That means, roughly speaking, that you'll spend time outside of class focusing on theoretical learning (by engaging with online content) and you'll spend time in class focusing on synthesizing theoretical and practical learning by working on assignments and problems on your own, with a partner, or in small groups.</p>
    
    <h3>Schedule</h3>
    <p>Here is the schedule for CS131. Please notice the Legend column on the far right. Roughly speaking, green days and orange days are required to attend and purple days are flexible attendance days. See the syllabus for further details on required vs. flexible attendance days.</p>
    
    <h3>Piazza</h3>
    <p>Almost all of the course communication will be on Piazza (rather than personal email). Piazza helps us (the profs and grutors) prioritize your questions, and asking a question over Piazza will almost always get you a quicker answer than sending an email. Click the Piazza button to the left to go to our Piazza page, or you can use this direct link: <a href="https://piazza.com/hmc/spring2023/cs131">https://piazza.com/hmc/spring2023/cs131</a></p>
    
    <h3>Class Meeting Times</h3>
    <p>In-class practical learning sessions (times to work specifically on course assignments and labs):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Section 1: MW 9:35am - 10:50am Pacific Time</li>
      <li>Section 2: MW 11:00am - 12:15pm Pacific Time</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Grade Estimator</h3>
    <p>We have created a CS131 grade estimator to help you understand your progress in the course and to help you decide what to prioritize in order to meet your learning goals.</p>
    
    <h3>Absence and Extension Forms</h3>
    <p>If you need to miss class or need an extension, please fill out these forms. For more complex absences and extensions, feel free to email us or make appointments as necessary.</p>
    <p>You can always take a one-day, no-questions-asked extension, but please keep in mind that regularly keeping up with deadlines will help you have the best experience in CS131. But, when you need the flexibility, please let us know via the one-day, no-questions-asked extension form.</p>
    <p>If you need to miss a required class or if you need more than a one day extension due to personal circumstances (health, travel, family, emergency, etc.), please let us know via this form for excused absence and longer-term extension tracking.</p>
    
    <h3>Office hours and grutoring times</h3>
    <p>Grutoring and office hours will be in person in MCSC 203 / 204 / 205.</p>
    <p>Here is a <a href="office_hours.html">link to the grutor and office hours schedule</a>.</p>
