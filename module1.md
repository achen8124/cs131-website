## Intro and Overview

### Overview
We are very excited to have you in CS 131 Programming Languages! This is the Part 1 of Module 1.1. There actually isn't much here in Part 1 for this Module, but generally, Part 1 of each Module will contain an overview with possibly some short recap, and importantly, links to any slides or materials.

In Module 1, we will introduce three important themes for CS131:

1. Functions are Awesome

2. Programs are Data

3. PLs + people 

We'll touch on each of these themes as we go through a little history and context and also tell you a little bit about some of the more fine-grained topics you'll see in CS131.

### Today's slides
Today's content available as a shared Google slides presentation. Feel free to make a copy of the slides for yourself on Google Drive, or download the slides for offline viewing. Slides in future lectures will also be available the same way.

### Collaborative Module Summaries
You can check out the collaborative module summary and add to it if you like. As you go through the Module, adding notes to this document might help those who come after you. Or, you can check out the summary and see what others thought was important. 

### Time Tracking
By the way, at the end of this module, I'll ask you to estimate how long it took you to complete, so keep that in mind as you continue through the next pages.

As a heads up, there's about 42 minutes of video broken into several segments and a handful of exercises to complete. 

## What is a Programming Language?

### What even is a programming language?

Before we begin, let's check in with the ideas you already have about programming languages. Type in your answer below, then continue to the next section.

**Note:** When you submit an answer, the whole page will refresh. We know this is annoying, and it annoys me too when I am creating Sakai pages. I feel your pain. With that caveat in mind, please complete the following question.

<div class="question">
  <p>"What is a programming language? Try to write a definition of the term "programming language" that you think everyone would agree with. Alternatively, write a definition of "programming language" that you agree with but you think others may not."</p>
  <form>
    <label for="answer1">Your answer:</label>
    <textarea class="answer" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>
    <br>
    <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="displayMessage(this)">
  </form>
  <div id="messageContainer1" class="message"></div>
</div>

## Pre-history of PLs

### Some historical background of programming languages

The study of programming languages has a rich and interesting history. In this segment, we'll tell you one small thread in the story of programming languages. 

After watching these two videos, we will ask you to reflect on how you personally relate to the approaches taken by Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, as well as the ideas of Lebniz, Boole, and Locke.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/450924286" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

Please answer both of these questions in the box below:
1. Do you identify more with Ada's more abstract way of looking at things, Charles's more engineering-oriented mindset, or somewhere in between?
2. Do you think that that human thought can be described of as a form of computation, similar to how Ada, Leibniz, Boole, and Locke had suggested?

## Functions are Awesome and What Even is CS131?

In this short segment, we will begin to tell you some of the big ideas you'll learn about in this course, and we'll also give some insight regarding what this class is not about.

One important theme of CS131 is that **functions are awesome!**

### First, a dash of metapedagogy...

I'd like you to spend a moment thinking about the ways that people might learn about the field of programming languages.

One way that we could teach a class on programming languages is to learn a little bit about a different language each week, and perhaps compare and contrast those languages. This isn't what we will do in CS131!
Why might it NOT be a good idea to study programming languages by learning the syntax and semantics of a different programming language every week?

## Programs = Data
In this segment we will discuss another important theme of CS131: **programs are data!** Just like you can write programs to manipulate and compute with numbers, strings, cows, and so on, you can also write programs that manipulate and compute with other programs! This is an important PLs concept that we will see throughout the semester. This video will give a high level introduction to this important idea.

Here are a few questions to check your understanding.

What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?

### Required Comments Section

In the comments section here, please do either 1 or 2 or both of these tasks:

1. Answer one of the following questions in your own words 

  a. Why might it be a good idea for an interpreter to represent an input program as a string? Why might it be a bad idea to use a string representation?

  b. Why might it be a good idea for an interpreter to represent an input program as a tree? Why might it be a bad idea to use a tree representation?

2. Respond to or elaborate on comments from at least one other student.

## PLs + People

Programming languages are designed by people to be used by people. We think it is important to recognize this and reflect on how this has an impact on the world. In this segment, we will explore one aspect of this theme of PLs + People, and your first homework will touch on this aspect as well.

### Required Comments Section

In the comments section here, please do at least one of the following:

a. answer the prompt

b. respond to another students's response

c. elaborate on another student's response

d. ask a follow up question

**Prompt:** What effect, if any, can programming-language designers have on society?

## Wrapping up
You made it through the first module! Great work! 

### Next steps: Homework 1 due this Sunday 11:59 pm Pacific Time

After completing this page, you are ready to start the first homework assignment.

You can access HW1 by using the navigation bar on the left under

Modules -> Welcome to Programming Languages -> HW 1: peoPLe, or

Assignments -> HW 1: peoPLe

### Getting Credit for Modules
In general, in order to get credit for completing any (sub)module, you'll need to make it to the "completion" page and submit 1 or 2 responses to completion-based, low stakes prompts. This is primarily to help me have a sense overall student progress through the modules and make sure we are all on track. Thanks!
