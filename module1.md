## Intro and Overview

### Overview
We are very excited to have you in CS 131 Programming Languages! This is the Part 1 of Module 1.1. There actually isn't much here in Part 1 for this Module, but generally, Part 1 of each Module will contain an overview with possibly some short recap, and importantly, links to any slides or materials.

In Module 1, we will introduce three important themes for CS131:

1. Functions are Awesome

2. Programs are Data

3. PLs + people 

We'll touch on each of these themes as we go through a little history and context and also tell you a little bit about some of the more fine-grained topics you'll see in CS131.

### Today's slides
Today's content available as a shared Google slides presentation. Feel free to make a copy of the slides for yourself on Google Drive, or download the slides for offline viewing. Slides in future lectures will also be available the same way.

### Collaborative Module Summaries
You can check out the collaborative module summary and add to it if you like. As you go through the Module, adding notes to this document might help those who come after you. Or, you can check out the summary and see what others thought was important. 

### Time Tracking
By the way, at the end of this module, I'll ask you to estimate how long it took you to complete, so keep that in mind as you continue through the next pages.

As a heads up, there's about 42 minutes of video broken into several segments and a handful of exercises to complete. 

## What is a Programming Language?

### What even is a programming language?

Before we begin, let's check in with the ideas you already have about programming languages. Type in your answer below, then continue to the next section.

Note: When you submit an answer, the whole page will refresh. We know this is annoying, and it annoys me too when I am creating Sakai pages. I feel your pain. With that caveat in mind, please complete the following question.

TEXT FIELD HEREEEEE

We are not actually going to provide a definition of a programming language at this point, but you'll have a chance to explore this question more over the course of the semester, in fact, even starting at HW1! 




## Pre-history of PLs

### Some historical background of programming languages

The study of programming languages has a rich and interesting history. In this segment, we'll tell you one small thread in the story of programming languages. 

After watching these two videos, we will ask you to reflect on how you personally relate to the approaches taken by Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, as well as the ideas of Lebniz, Boole, and Locke.
