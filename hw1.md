# HW 1: peoPLe

## Overview

In this assignment, you will read some materials and respond to them. Most of the materials are about the history of programming languages and some ways in which culture and programming languages are entwined.

The goals of this assignment are:

- Familiarize yourself with the syllabus.
- Read and think about the history of programming languages and the culture around programming languages.
- Become familiar with our assignment workflow: using GitHub and Gradescope.

**A note on the due date.** One important purpose of this assignment is to make sure the HW workflow goes smoothly for everybody. You should give your best effort to submit this assignment by Sunday because if anybody is having trouble with GitHub, Gradescope, etc., we want to discover that *as early as possible* and resolve it. So, in the off chance that something goes wrong (e.g., Gradescope can't find your CS131 HW 1 Repo for some strange reason), don't worry! We'll fix it on Monday, and you can submit it then. But, keep in mind that Monday submission is for technical difficulties only. If you wait until Monday to even attempt submitting, then that is a different story. Please don't procrastinate on this one because you're going to need this workflow again *immediately* for HW2.

## Collaboration

For this assignment, you will work on your own. For all future assignments, you can work with a partner.

You are, of course, still free to talk to other people in the course about the course materials. Just remember the "in your head rule" and "understanding, not rote learning rule" from the syllabus.


# HW 1 Part 1

This is the first part of the assignment.

## Readings

The readings will take you a few hours, so you may want to start early and space it out. Reading—and figuring out the assignment workflow—will constitute the majority of the time you will spend on this assignment. After the readings, there is about 1 hour's worth of work, where you will think about and respond to the readings and to questions about programming-language design.

**Begin by reading the syllabus.**

- [The syllabus](#)

For real, please read the syllabus!

Trivia: Snoop Dogg lived in Claremont from 1996 until 2007.

**Next, there are two readings related to the history and culture of programming.**

- [C is Manly, Python is for "n00bs": How False Stereotypes Turn Into Technical "Truth" by Yang and Rabkin](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/c-is-manly-python-is-for-n00bs-how-false-stereotypes-turn-into-technical-truths)
- [This talk by Captain (later Admiral) Grace Hopper](https://sakai.claremont.edu/access/content/group/CX_mtg_HMC_CS_131_SP23/CS-131-Hopper-Annotated.pdf). The linked document is a PDF that is annotated with some historical information by Prof. Chris Stone. *If you use a text-to-speech aid, and this PDF is not accessible to your aid, please let us know.*

## Assignment workflow

In this course, we will be using GitHub and Gradescope to work on assignments. You will check out the files from GitHub and create a copy in a repository of your own. You will work on the assignment and push the results to GitHub. When you are ready to submit the assignment, you will submit it on Gradescope. **You won't be able to do all these steps in the workflow until we have added you to the GitHub for this course**, but regardless please take a moment to at least ***review* the assignment workflow** so that you are prepared in class. We will all get started on this together in class on Wednesday during the first week of classes.

[Assignment Workflow](#)

Having read the high-level assignment workflow, you can also get a head start, if you want, by going through this [detailed HW 1 walk-through](#) which is also available from the "HOWTOs" tab on the left side of the Sakai site. However, you will not be able to complete the walk-through yet until I add all student usernames to the CS131 GitHub and open the repos for cloning.

# HW 1 Part 2

You should have filled out the survey that we emailed out and provided your GitHub username so that we could give students access to the assignments. **If you did not fill out that survey, go find that email and fill it out now (or ask for the link if you can't find it).** If you experience any issues, let us know! Come to office hours, grutoring hours, or post on Piazza. One goal of this first HW is to work out any issues with technology so that future assignments go smoothly.

To get your copy of the assignment, follow along with the description of the assignment workflow linked at the bottom of this section. Part of the way through the process, you will need a "GitHub Classroom" link for the assignment. Here it is:

[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/z06X8gM7)

### Respond to the syllabus

Open the homework file `answers.txt`. In the appropriate place, write your responses to the questions about the syllabus.

### Respond to the Yang and Rabkin article

Pick a 1–2 sentence passage from the Yang and Rabkin article. In the appropriate place, in `answers.txt`, copy the passage (between quotation marks) and write a short (~50-word) reaction to the passage.

### Respond to the Hopper talk

In the appropriate place in `answers.txt`, write a short description (~50 words) of something from the Hopper talk that surprised you or stood out to you in some way.

### Think about programming-language design

In this part of the assignment, we will reflect on the design of programming languages.

First, [choose a random number between 1 and 10](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=random+number+between+1+and+10). Map that number to one of these 10 most commonly used spoken languages, by the number of native speakers, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers):

1. Mandarin Chinese
2. Spanish
3. English
4. Hindi
5. Bengali
6. Portuguese
7. Russian
8. Japanese
9. Western Punjabi
10. Marathi

**Your Task:** In the appropriate place in `answers.txt`, describe your language's:

- *Character set*. The character set is the set of valid characters used when writing the language. If the character set has a name, you can use the name; you do not need to list all the valid characters.

Now, [choose a different random number between 1 and 10](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=random+number+between+1+and+10). Map that number to one of these 10 most commonly used programming languages, according to the [TIOBE index](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/):

1. C
2. Java
3. Python
4. C++
5. C#
6. Visual Basic
7. JavaScript
8. PHP
9. R
10. Groovy

**Your Task:** In the appropriate place in `answers.txt`, describe your language's:

- *Character set.*  You can summarize it using a human language, if you'd like (for example, "The letters of the English language, plus some operators").
- *keywords.* You can usually find a language's keywords (also known as *reserved words*) by Googling *<language name> keywords*.

**Your Task:** Answer the remaining questions in `answers.txt`.

## Turn in the assignment

You're almost done!  You just need to **push to GitHub and submit on Gradescope.** Make sure you have answered all the questions and completed all the tasks in `answers.txt`.

**Note:** Remember that if something goes wrong with submitting the assignment on Sunday, we will have Monday as a fallback day to fix any technical issues. However, waiting until Monday to even attempt submitting will not be acceptable unless you encounter technical difficulties.


## Where to go from here

If you liked the themes of the course and this assignment so far, here are some other things you might like!

- [Access Computing](https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/). We explored how one's human language might intersect with the design of a programming language, making the programming language less accessible to some. The Access Computing initiative focuses on other forms of accessibility: their goal is to increase the participation of people with disabilities in computing fields.
- The Swift programming language and developers have some [great](https://www.apple.com/education/k12/learn-to-code/) [materials](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10681/) for programming games designed for people who are blind or have limited vision, and for those who are sighted.
- A couple of books from which we pulled the historical information:
    - [The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage](https://www.amazon.com/Thrilling-Adventures-Lovelace-Babbage-Protectorate/dp/0143034430)
    - [Logicomix](https://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-Epic-Search-Truth/dp/1596914521)
- A talk called ["The Programming Language Called Classical Chinese"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBhg2p8aAQ0).
- A talk called ["Inventing on Principle"](http://worrydream.com/#!/InventingOnPrinciple) about how our programming tools influence our programming behavior. One of our favorites!
